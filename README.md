  - SFTP (configuring EC2 instance for SSH and VS Code editor for SFTP via extension) -> you can secure the tranfer of files to the file-sharing site, no problem!
  - A login page
  - Upload any kind of file.
  - View most types of files.
  - Delete files

### Tech

The file-sharing site uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Visual Studio Code] - A great text editor!
* [HTML5] - awesome web-based text editor.
* [git-repo-url] 
* [Bitbucket] - provides a UI to view the files of the project.


**Free Software, Hell Yeah!**
